      <p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

      Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>

      <p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

      Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>

      <p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

      I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Oh yeah, good luck with that.</p>
